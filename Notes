Hi All,

If I may send the contents of the sheet of paper that we used tonight:

Working Title: DogFit
-----------------------------

Functions:
--------------

-Movement of dog
-Feeding bowl proximity
- Data logging
-Path tracking
-Max speed
-Mass/Force/Energy burned
-Show lazy = red, OK = blue, busy = green
-Display key data on small screen
-Attach to dog, e.g. belt/collar

Available parts:
-------------------

Dog? Chicken? Cat? (Jeff, Aaron?)
Screen
Bluetooth device
Memory core
6 axis accel/gyro
Arduino basic module
Timer module
LEDs (via Jeff?)
Fabric, bands, collar (via Katy?)

Milestones:
---------------

1) Get text to display (done)
2) Display current accel/gyro readings on screen (partially done with z-axis data)
3) Display current speed and cumulative distance traversed on screen
4) Store speed, accel, distance over time for later display in graph or so
5) Download data into i-phone and display graph, AND/OR display some or all of that data on small screen AND/OR with LEDs
6)?

Points to note:
------------------

-Requires some calculation, e.g. v = a x t (integrated over time since a is not constant) d = v x t. Time has to be set (or set-able) e.g. for demo 1 minute maybe
-We do not make use of gyro data so far
-We had a small problem in milestone 2, the program seemed to stop after a few seconds
-Small issues with variable transformation, e.g. float to string
-We will probably have about 5 min to present the project, we should allow some time to practice this a little to make sure it runs smooth, especially if animals are involved
-It may be more important to have a completed project that is simple, than having a fancy project that is not complete
-Live animal may be very useful to have

Other ideas:
----------------

-
??
-Could this be made into a fitness or gold device, measuring quickness and extent of hip turn for example?

How much is missing? Comments? Ideas? Did I get everyone's email right?
