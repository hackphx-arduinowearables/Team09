The DAUG

What it is!
--------------
The DAUG stands for Dog Activity Units... Germany

It's a two part system to measure the activity of man's best friend.  The first part is the DAUG Carrier that is worn by the dog. The DAUG carrier connects to the DAUG IOS app running on an IPad, because it just works.  The Carrier talks to the IOS app using bluetooth.

The DAUG carrier gives realtime feedback through six Neopixel LEDs.  Red means the dog has been lazy, blue mean the dog is taking it easy, and green means your dog is a super DAUG dog.

The IOS app also displays a meter rating your dog against other breeds.
